<h2>Food:normalize</h2>
    
<p>Only sets the weight to 1.0. </p>

<h3>Note:</h3>

    
<p><b>Syntax:</b></p> 
<p>normalize()</p>


<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
      &gt;&gt;milk=Food.new{water=88.13, protein=3.15, CHO=4.80, lipid=3.25, ash=0.67} <br>
      &gt;&gt;water=Food.new{water=100} <br>

      <br>
      
      &gt;&gt;powder=milk-0.87*water <br>
      &gt;&gt;powder <br>
      Weight (unit weight)=0.13
</p>

<p>
      This is a rather important function as the food material that is a result of an <br>
      addition or a subtraction operation can have a weight different than 1.0. <br>
      <br>
      For example: if you were to use the variable powder as is in another mathematical operation, <br>
      its weight would have been considered as <b>0.13 units</b>.
