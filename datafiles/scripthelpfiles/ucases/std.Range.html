<h1>Range Class</h1>
<p>
    A range is a user specified region within a worksheet. It does not have a reserved internal data storage; 
    only reads from and writes to the specified region by the user. 
</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Creating Range</h3>

<p>
    Unlike Worksheet, where indices (1,1) refers to <em>A1</em>, for a Range, (1,1) refers to the topleft 
    corner of the <em>specified</em> region.
</p>

<p>
    -- (1,1) refers to B1 <br>
    &gt;&gt; range=std.Range.new("Sheet1!B1:B5")  <br />

    <br />
    <br>

    --Create a range from the selection of the user <br>
    &gt;&gt; range=ws:selection() 
</p>
